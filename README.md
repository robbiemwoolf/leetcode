## Problem Solving Tips by Teddy Mitchell

### Keep in mind that this is a small part of the entire journey

1. Understand the problem - aka "reflect the question back into your own words."
    - Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?
    - What are you asked to find or show?
    - Can you restate the problem in your own words?
    - Can you think of a picture or diagram that might help you understand the problem?
    - Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?

2. Devise a plan - aka "Pseudocode"
    - Guess and check           |   - Look for a pattern
    - Make an orderly list      |   - Draw a picture
    - Eliminate possibilities   |   - Solve a simpler problem
    - Use symmetry              |   - Use a model
    - Consider special cases    |   - Work backwards
    - Use direct reasoning      |   - Use a formula
    - Solve an equation         |   - Be ingenious

3. Carry out the plan - aka "code your Pseudocode"
    - Third. Carry out your plan.
    - Carrying out your plan of the solution, check each step. Can you see clearly that the step is correct? Can you prove that it is correct?

4. Look back - aka "refactor"
    - Fourth. Examine the solution obtained.
    - Can you check the result? Can you check the argument?
    - Can you derive the solution differently? Can you see it at a glance?
    - Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem?
